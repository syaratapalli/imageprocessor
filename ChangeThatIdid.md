the instruction in course 2 mostly reflect mac settings not somany instructions for windows. I had to debug lots of errors. 
It took me lot of time. for example, the build path in package.json file doesnt work on windows systems. 
I had to download recognisable zip folder and still needs to alter the code that was given. 
"npm run clean && tsc && cp package.json www/package.json && cd www && 7z.exe -r a Archive.zip . && cd .." like this. 
Even to save the filerimage I had to use other npm functions. 
It still takes time to acknowledge all the files in work
Initially My beanstalk is not working properly but my code got deployed successfuly. 
its up and running.
